    Mandelbrot set
    M ⊆ C  
    ∀c ∈ M 

    converges
    bounded in absolute value
    compact because it is closed and contained in a close disk of radius 2 around the origin
    Z_{n} does not tent to infinity
    elements not in M, diverge into infinity
    
    ẓ_{n+1} = z_{n}^2 + c, z_{0} = c

    f_{c}(z) = z^{2} + c, ∀c ∈ M
    f_{c}(0), f_{c}(f_{c}(0)), f_{c}(f_{c}(f_{c}(0)))




    
    |Z_{n}| <= 2, ∀n,
    r_{max} = 2
    

    The intersection of M with the real axis is [-2, 1/4]
    

    


    z = x + yi
    |z| = (x∗x + y∗y)^{1/2}
    z^{2} = x^{2} - y^{2} + 2∗x∗y∗i

    x = r∗cos(θ)
    y = r∗sen(θ)

PLOTTING ALGORITHMS FOR THE MANDELBROT SET 

Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing
for each, point c. whether the sequence f_{c}(0), f_{c}(f_{c}(0)), goes to infinity


Treating the real and imaginary parts of C as image coordinates on the complex plane,
pixels may then be coloured according to how soon the sequence
|f_{c}(0)|, |f_{c}(f_{c}(0))|,..., crosses an arbitrary chosen threshold.
(the threshold has to be at least 2, but is otherwise arbitrary).

most widely use and simplest algorith "escape time algorith" repeating
calculations on each (x,y) point in the plot area.

asotiated behavior calculation with pixel colour.
