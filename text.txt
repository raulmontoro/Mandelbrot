Mandelbrot set
    Adrien Donady

mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, tribute to
pioneer of fractal geometry

set of complex numbers C

f_{c}(z) = z^{2} + c    converges

z_{0} = 0 critical point

f_{c}(0), f_{c}(f_{c}(0)), f_{c}(f_{c}(f_{c}(0))), ..., bounded in absolute value

|Z_{n}| <= 2, all n

compact because it is closed and contained in a close disk of radius 2 around
the origin

The intersection of M with the real axis is [-2, 1/4]
M is the Mandelbrot set

Z_{n} does not tent to infinity

r_{max} = 2



PLOTTING ALGORITHMS FOR THE MANDELBROT SET 

Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing
for each, point c. whether the sequence f_{c}(0), f_{c}(f_{c}(0)), goes to infinity


Treating the real and imaginary parts of C as image coordinates on the complex plane,
pixels may then be coloured according to how soon the sequence
|f_{c}(0)|, |f_{c}(f_{c}(0))|,..., crosses an arbitrary chosen threshold.
(the threshold has to be at least 2, but is otherwise arbitrary).

most widely use and simplest algorith "escape time algorith" repeating
calculations on each (x,y) point in the plot area.

asotiated behavior calculation with pixel colour.

INFINITY REPRESENTATION IN JAVA

double inf = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
System.out.println(inf + 5);        # Infinity
System.out.println(inf - inf);        # Same as Double.NaN
System.out.println(inf * -1);        # Same as Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY

Integer myInf = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
Integer myInf = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
